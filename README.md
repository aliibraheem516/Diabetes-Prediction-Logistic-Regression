# Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict diabetes based on a medical dataset. The dataset includes features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The code demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions with an example input.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `diabetes2.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- `Insulin`: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function, representing genetic predisposition.
- `Age`: Age of the patient (years).
- `Outcome`: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Files

- `diabetes2.csv`: The dataset containing medical information and diagnostic measurements.
- `Diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.
